        This is my third post. Holy crap I'm running out of things to type. JK. I've been having fun in Tulsa. It's like a much easier test drive compared to Tampa. I'm still a bit inside my shell but I'm getting out a lot more. I kinda hate the cold so I'm a lot less comfortable going around. I try to avoid backpain outside of desk situations where I'm already comfy, but I get real sad sitting at home. Maybe I need a new chair.
