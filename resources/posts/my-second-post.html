    This is my second post. I'm still on the same part of the laravel tutorial but I'm feeling better, and getting more used to this keyboard which sucks because it's slightly different from my work keyboard and that is a hassle for me. Otherwise, I'm enjoying this tutorial still, I'm enjoying using Sail and Docker on Laravel nowadays instead of artisan and running serve. The local host feels a bit slow though. Maybe this laptop is just getting old. Oh yeah I also already made a repo. I should start committing some stuff when I'm done with this episode.
