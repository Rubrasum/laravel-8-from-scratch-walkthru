        I'm just kinda rushing through this laravel tutorial. I've done this tutorial almost 3 or 4 times now but this is the time that I'll actually finish it and also accomplish my goal but for now I just need to fill up a bunch of space for my second post. There's 3 guys playing chess near me and I only have 10 minutes left to work at this place before they kick me out but I'll probably keep working at home bcause I'm having fun with this, thanks Laray.
