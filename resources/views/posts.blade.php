        I'm just kinda rushing through this laravel tutorial. I've done this tutorial almost 3 or 4 times now but this is the time that I'll actually finish it and also accomplish my goal but for now I just need to fill up a bunch of space for my second post. There's 3 guys playing chess near me and I only have 10 minutes left to work at this place before they kick me out but I'll probably keep working at home bcause I'm having fun with this, thanks Laray.

        This is my second post. I'm still on the same part of the laravel tutorial but I'm feeling better, and getting more used to this keyboard which sucks because it's slightly different from my work keyboard and that is a hassle for me. Otherwise, I'm enjoying this tutorial still, I'm enjoying using Sail and Docker on Laravel nowadays instead of artisan and running serve. The local host feels a bit slow though. Maybe this laptop is just getting old. Oh yeah I also already made a repo. I should start committing some stuff when I'm done with this episode.

        This is my third post. Holy crap I'm running out of things to type. JK. I've been having fun in Tulsa. It's like a much easier test drive compared to Tampa. I'm still a bit inside my shell but I'm getting out a lot more. I kinda hate the cold so I'm a lot less comfortable going around. I try to avoid backpain outside of desk situations where I'm already comfy, but I get real sad sitting at home. Maybe I need a new chair.
